				'\n' +
				'### Business warnings\n' +

				'Collective members sumit evidences with expections to retain at their ranks or to be promoted to higher ranks. Failure to handle them may lead to members bumped to lower ranks accidently, or not to be promoted in time.\n' +
				'\n' +
				'Members themselves may forget or fail to check their demotion/promotion status which will lead them fail to submit evidences.\n' +
				'\n' +
				'We propose to implement some components warn:\n' +
				'1. Evidences to be handled for members management.\n' +
				'2. Conspicuous component to show demotion/promotion status to connected members.\n' +
				'3. Notifications when members demotion/promotion period is closed to end.\n' +
				"4. Salary cycle time points warnings. So members won't miss registration and claim.\n" +
				'\n' +
				'### Profile enhancement\n' +
				'\n' +
				"We will be able to see a fellowship/ambassador member's basic info and life cycle on his/her profile page.\n" +
				'\n' +
				'- Rank, activeness, salary status.\n' +
				'- Membership records including promotion, demotion, retain, induction, etc.\n' +
				'- History evidece records for promotion/retain.\n' +

				'- Salary registration and claim history.\n' +
				'- Statistics about total salary, promotion/demotion times.\n' +
				'\n' +
				'### Statistics\n' +

				"- How much money totaly we spent for collectives' salary.\n" +
				'- Members ordered by total salary received.\n' +
				'- Members distribution by ranks, salary, etc.\n' +
				'- Promotion/Demotion times by ranks.\n' +
				'\n' +
				'### Sub treasury\n' +

				'2. History and ongoing proposal list and detail page.\n' +
				'\n' +
				'### Referenda enhancement\n' +
				'\n' +
				'- Collective referenda templates. They can help fellowship/ambassador members quick create referenda.\n' +
				"- Show corresponding evidence info for a ongoing referendum to promote a member or to retain a member at his/her rank. So voters can check the target member's work for vote reference.\n" +
				'- Auto fill context for specified referenda including member rank management referendum and remark referendum.\n' +
				'- Show referenda which connected member is not yet voted.\n' +
